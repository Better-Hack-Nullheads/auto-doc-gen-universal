# Product Management API

<APIMetadata version="v1.0" date="2024-07-29" framework="NestJS" />

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the Product Management API, enabling users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on product resources. This API is designed to be intuitive and follows RESTful principles, allowing for seamless integration into various applications.

<Callout type="info">
  This API is part of a larger project analysis system but focuses specifically on product resource management.

## Framework Information

This API is built using **NestJS**, a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. NestJS leverages TypeScript and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).

**Key NestJS Patterns & Conventions:**

*   **Controllers:** Handle incoming requests and return responses. They are decorated with `@Controller()` and typically define a base path for their routes.
*   **Services:** Encapsulate business logic and data manipulation. They are injected into controllers using dependency injection.
*   **Modules:** Organize the application into cohesive blocks of functionality.
*   **Decorators:** Used extensively for defining routes (`@Get()`, `@Post()`, `@Put()`, `@Patch()`, `@Delete()`), handling request data (`@Param()`, `@Query()`, `@Body()`), and more.
*   **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):** Plain JavaScript objects that define the shape of data transferred over the network. Often validated using NestJS's built-in `ValidationPipe`.
